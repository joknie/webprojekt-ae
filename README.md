# Webprojekt

This website was created as part of a class assignment. The working site is
found in the folder /dist. 

## root, _templates and _includes folders

Aside from the usual README.md and .gitignore, the root folder only contains
the .pug files from which some of the pages in dist were created. The subfolder
_includes contains .pug files that were used as includes in the ones in root.

## The site in /dist

The contents of Index.html and PAP.html were created according to specs in the
assignment. For Inhalt.html students could choose their own topic and design.
I stuck with the design and decided not only write about 
[Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug), but also use it to create that page. 
Pug.html was created to provide commented code examples.

Index.html and PAP.html were written as HTML as required by the assignment and
are placed in the dist folder (where the converter put the converted pug) to
avoid having to copy files back and forth when testing.

The folder /img includes some images used on the pages.
